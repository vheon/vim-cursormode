# Cursor Mode
Change the color of the cursor based on the mode we're in for terminal vim.
At the moment it is tested for iTerm2 only (because is the only thing that I use) but basic implementation for xterm/urxvt is there and should work.

# Why would I want this?

Vim already has `:h 'showmode'` but I like colors to distinguish things.
Other plugin offer something colored like [vim-airline][] or [powerline][]/[vim-powerline][] that let you color part of the statusline based on the mode we are in but specially if we have big screen it is not so easy to see the color in the bottom left corner of the statusline,
so I prefer coloring what I'm looking at that usually is where my cursor is.

# How to use it

Install it as any plugin, using your plugin manager of choice:

[vim-plug][]

```viml
Plug 'vheon/vim-cursormode'
```

[Vundle.vim][]

```viml
Plugin 'vheon/vim-cursormode'
```

[NeoBundle.vim][]

```viml
NeoBundle 'vheon/vim-cursormode'
```

Or using [vim-pathogen][]

# Cursor colors
For setting the color to be used in the different mode you have a couple of options:

* define a variable `g:cursormode_color_map`
* define a variable with a name like `g:cursormode#{colorscheme}#color_map` 
i.e. `let cursormode#solarized#color_map = {...}`
This kind of maps are reloaded if you change the colorscheme.
As you may have noticed this are autoload variable, so you could define them in a
`autoload/cursormode/{colorscheme}.vim` file. So for example you could ship this file with a colorscheme.

If none of the above are defined we use a default color map using the colors in the default colorscheme in iTerm2

## Color map format

Every color map is in the form:

```viml
let cursormode_color_map = {
      \   "mode":      "#rrggbb",
      ...
      \ }
```

The colors are in the form of `#rrggbb`.
The mode string is the return value of the function stored in
`g:cursormode_mode_func` (default is `:h mode()`).

For example this is a possible map:

```viml
let cursormode_color_map = {
      \   "n":      "#FFFFFF",
      \   "i":      "#0000FF",
      \   "v":      "#00FF00",
      \   "V":      "#FF0000",
      \   "\<C-V>": "#FFFF00",
      \ }
```

If you change the mode function, you can be more precise and do mappings like that:

```viml
function! cursormode_get_mode()
    let l:mode = mode()
    if l:mode ==# 'i' && (&readonly || ! &modifiable)
        return 'i_readonly'
    endif
    if l:mode ==# 'i' && (&paste)
        return 'i_paste'
    endif
    return l:mode
endfunction

let cursormode_mode_func = 'cursormode_get_mode'

let cursormode_color_map = {
      \   "n":          "#FFFFFF",
      \   "i":          "#0000FF",
      \   "i_paste":    "#00FFFF",
      \   "i_readonly": "#FF00FF",
      \   "v":          "#00FF00",
      \   "V":          "#FF0000",
      \   "\<C-V>":     "#FFFF00",
      \ }
```

If you want to specify a color for a mode based on the `background` you can do it appending the background string to the mode

For example here is my solarized map with the normal mode color based on the background:

```viml
let cursormode_solarized_color_map = {
      \   "nlight": "#657b83",
      \   "ndark":  "#839496",
      \   "i":      "#268bd2",
      \   "v":      "#cb4b16",
      \   "V":      "#b58900",
      \   "\<C-V>": "#6c71c4",
      \ }
```

# Known Issues

* At the moment only tested in iTerm2.
* Sporadically the view is moved, so for example I enter Insert mode and the current line is moved at the top as if I typed `zt`. I didn't find a way of debug this thing, so any input on this is welcome.
* Do not work when ssh into a remote machine

# TODO

* fallback to coloring the entire statusline when using vim on remote machine through ssh
* Make a compatibility layer with `guicursor`

Idea stolen from [http://www.blaenkdenum.com/posts/a-simpler-vim-statusline/][]
He uses the `guicursor` option which it's for GUI, MSDOW and Win32 console only
but I use terminal vim on iTerm2 only at the moment so I thoght about sending escape codes to
iTerm2 to change the cursor color.
